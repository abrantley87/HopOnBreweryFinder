# Hop On Brewery Finder
â€‹
The Hop On Brewery Finder is a website that dynamically displays individual beers made by craft brewers in Columbus, Ohio that can be discovered by public users. Users are invited to create an account and gain access to a brewery passport feature that maintains a list of beers the user has added to their passport, their ratings, and whether they have been drunk. Users are also able to create a pub crawl itinerary of their favorite breweries that generates a route via Google directions API between stops and allows users to print their list.

This project was the final capstone project at Tech Elevator Java Bootcamp and was built over the course of 2 weeks utilizing Java, Restful API, Spring Boot, JSON, PostgreSQL, JUnit testing, Google Directions API, Vue.Js, HTML, and CSS.
